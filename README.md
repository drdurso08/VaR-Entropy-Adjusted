In this paper I present a One step ahead VaR estimation that adjusts the quantile with respect to an Entropy indicator based on volume
I show that the loss function is lower in statistically significant sense and, in terms of expected shortfall, the loss is reduced with respect ti the 95% VaR
using a Diebold-Mariano test. All this result is based on the seasonal effect that the randomness of entropy exhibits on a weekly basis.
